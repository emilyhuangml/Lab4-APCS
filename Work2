# ^^^failed attempt bc I read the question wrong ^^^
# I looked at other people's solution and had to analyze it for a long time to finally understand what it meant:
n = 600851475143
i = 2 #starting prime factor

while i * i < n: #bc i can't be greater than the square root of n (ex. prime factors of 25 is 5 and 5, can't be greater than that)
    while n%i == 0: #divides n so it is not divisible by multiples of the current prime factor
        n = n / i
    i = i + 1
print (n)
